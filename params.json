Metadata is kept so that attribute information for a particular geometry is associated with that geometry.\r\n\r\nA web interface is provided which allows one or more polygon layers to be shown on top of a Google base layer. The layers are colourised based on a user-defined colour scheme, according to an equation input by the user. This equation can access any attributes available for the layer's geometry.\r\n\r\nAn example formula might be (for the Australian census) `100 * B2 / B3` which calculates the percentage of women in each polygon within the layer. In the case of the census, these attributes are available at on multiple geometries - from SA1 through to the Australia as a whole. EAlGIS calculates the SQL query needed to perform these calculations, including managing cross-table joins.\r\n\r\nThe system is quick and interactive. Any data generated can be downloaded in CSV format.\r\n\r\nMozilla Personas are used for user authentication. The system stores no passwords, access control relatively simple as it stands, and is via email address - Personas is used to establish that the person logging in has ownership of that email address.\r\n\r\nHave a look at [README.md](https://github.com/grahame/ealgis/blob/master/README.md) in the repository to get started setting up EAlGIS.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nEAlGIS has been developed by @grahame.
